# Tip Calculator

## *Emmanuel Gyabaah*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Custom colors palette selected
* [x] Add the ability to split the bill across any number of people.
* [x] Add the ability to round the total bill up or down, which should update the tip amount and
  percent automatically.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* I was a little stuck at grouping views in ConstraintLayout but found the solution as always on S.O
  (https://stackoverflow.com/a/44385829/24995341)
* Deciding where to put innerClass in a class inorder to have a well formatted code, I decided to put innerClasses at the bottom of parent class (https://stackoverflow.com/a/4730156/24995341)
